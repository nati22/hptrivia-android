Examples Reading Excel (.xls) Documents Using Python's xlrd

If running Ubuntu, you can install Python's xlrd module by running the command:

	$ sudo apt-get install python-xlrd

Open an Excel workbook:

	import xlrd
	workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('my_workbook.xls')

Grab list of worksheets in a workbook:
	
	import xlrd
	workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('my_workbook.xls')
	print workbook.sheet_names()

Grab a specific worksheet from a workbook:
	
	import xlrd
	workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('my_workbook.xls')
	worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_name('Sheet1')

Iterate over each worksheet in a workbook:

	import xlrd
	workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('my_workbook.xls')
	worksheets = workbook.sheet_names()
	for worksheet_name in worksheets:
		worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_name(worksheet_name)
		print worksheet

Iterate over each row of a worksheet:
	
	import xlrd
	workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('my_workbook.xls')
	worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_name('Sheet1')
	num_rows = worksheet.nrows - 1
	curr_row = -1
	while curr_row < num_rows:
		curr_row += 1
		row = worksheet.row(curr_row)
		print row

Grab the cell contents of each row of a worksheet:
	
	import xlrd
	workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('my_workbook.xls')
	worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_name('Sheet1')
	num_rows = worksheet.nrows - 1
	num_cells = worksheet.ncols - 1
	curr_row = -1
	while curr_row < num_rows:
		curr_row += 1
		row = worksheet.row(curr_row)
		print 'Row:', curr_row
		curr_cell = -1
		while curr_cell < num_cells:
			curr_cell += 1
			# Cell Types: 0=Empty, 1=Text, 2=Number, 3=Date, 4=Boolean, 5=Error, 6=Blank
			cell_type = worksheet.cell_type(curr_row, curr_cell)
			cell_value = worksheet.cell_value(curr_row, curr_cell)
			print '	', cell_type, ':', cell_value
